Software Implementation of the Intel® Query Processing Library (Intel® QPL) Beta
================================================================================

The Intel® Query Processing Library (Intel® QPL) provides a common interface for 
a number of commonly used algorithms. Using this library enables you to
automatically tune your application to many generations of processors without
changes in your application. The Intel® QPL provides high performance
implementations of data processing functions for existing hardware accelerator,
and/or software path in case if hardware accelerator is not available. Code written
within the library automatically takes advantage of available modern CPU
capabilities. This behavior can provide tremendous development and maintenance savings.
Use the Intel® QPL to improve performance of database, enterprise data, 
communications, and scientific/technical applications.


## Get Started

To set up and build the Intel QPL library, follow instructions below:

1. Make sure your system meets all [System Requirements](https://intel.github.io/qpl/documentation/introduction_docs/system_requirements.html).
2. Follow instructions to build the library. See [Installation](https://intel.github.io/qpl/documentation/get_started_docs/installation.html) for more details.


## Documentation

Documentation is delivered using GitHub Pages. See full Intel QPL [online documentation](https://intel.github.io/qpl/index.html).

>**Note:** The library is in beta state and its APIs may change as the library is actively developed.
