Intel® Query Processing Library (Intel® QPL) Beta
=================================================


The Intel® Query Processing Library (Intel® QPL) is an open-source library to provide
high-performance query processing operations on Intel CPUs. Intel® QPL is aimed to support 
capabilities of the new Intel® In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (Intel® IAA) available on Next
Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, codenamed Sapphire Rapids processor, such as very high
throughput compression and decompression combined with primitive analytic functions, as well as to
provide highly-optimized SW fallback on other Intel CPUs. Intel QPL primarily targets applications
such as big-data and in-memory analytic databases.


## Get Started

To set up and build the Intel QPL library, follow instructions below:

1. Make sure your system meets all [System Requirements](https://intel.github.io/qpl/documentation/get_started_docs/system_requirements.html).
2. Follow instructions to build the library. See [Installation](https://intel.github.io/qpl/documentation/get_started_docs/installation.html) for more details.


## Documentation

Documentation is delivered using GitHub Pages. See full Intel QPL [online documentation](https://intel.github.io/qpl/index.html).

>**Note:** The library is in beta state and its APIs may change as the library is actively developed.
