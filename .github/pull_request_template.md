# Checklist

## All Submissions

- [ ] Attached log with the results of functional testing using `software_path` and/or `hardware_path`. Required testing coverage depends on the nature of changes, e.g., changes to the API or middle-layer imply testing of both, however changes focused on `core-iaa/` only require `hardware_path`. If testing is not possible on the contributor side (e.g., due to lack of resources), please let maintainers know. More information on testing is in [Documentation](https://intel.github.io/qpl/documentation/get_started_docs/testing.html).
